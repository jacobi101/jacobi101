- Hello I'm Jacob, I work in the AI sector as a Professional Services Engineer.
- I am interested in data anlysis and machine learning. More specifically it's uses in visualization and prediction within scouting and player analysis for association football.
- Currently, I am learning the fundamentals of data science, with ambitions to use that for a more back end intensive job working in football or football media.
- I'm looking to collaborate on any projects that would involve that.
